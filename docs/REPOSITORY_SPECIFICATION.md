# Repository specification: aether-ai-infrastructure

**Status:** Documentation baseline copied from the Aether AI master specification. Implementation status must be verified separately.

## Mission

Infrastructure-as-code, environment provisioning, networking, managed dependencies, and operational baselines.

## Dependencies and connections

Deployment, observability, database, queue, cache.

## Owned capabilities

Environment isolation, state protection, least-privilege IAM, secret injection, backup/restore, network policies, cost controls.

## Non-goals

- Business logic owned by application/domain repositories.
- Committing secrets, credentials, state files, or customer data.
- Treating planned infrastructure as deployed or production-ready.

## Required contracts and controls

- Version public interfaces and document compatibility/deprecation policy.
- Enforce least privilege, isolation, auditability, and safe defaults.
- Document error handling, limits, retention, rollback, and recovery behavior.
- Include automated validation and review for security-sensitive changes.

## Test and release plan

- Unit/contract tests for the owned interfaces.
- Negative tests for permission boundaries and invalid configuration.
- Static analysis and dependency/license/security scanning.
- Integration smoke test in an isolated non-production environment.
- Explicit rollback and operator runbook before production rollout.

## Implementation gates

1. Confirm this responsibility and dependency graph in [master catalog](https://github.com/Monupatel62/aether-ai-platform/blob/main/docs/REPOSITORY_CATALOG.md).
2. Record unresolved choices in ADRs before committing to vendors or infrastructure.
3. Build the minimum viable capability with tests and documentation.
4. Update this specification and all affected consumers whenever a contract changes.

External source code is not copied by this specification. Verify exact versions, licenses, and security posture before any reuse.

## Security and privacy

Infrastructure changes can expose every service through misconfigured networks, IAM, state files, or public storage. Use least-privilege roles, protected state, network segmentation, encrypted backups, runtime secret management, environment isolation, and reviewed plans before applying changes.

## Test plan

Test policy-as-code, public exposure defaults, IAM least privilege, encrypted/protected state, environment isolation, backup/restore, drift detection, and safe plan review before apply.

Before release, add unit tests, contract tests for direct dependencies, negative authorization/input tests, and failure/recovery tests for the behavior this component owns. Use synthetic or sanitized data only.
